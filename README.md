## Window initialization and click event of add-in button

In the window folder, there is the main code file called Connect.vb from where the add-in does their functionality.
in that file there is a function called \_Button_Click(), there is shown how the window will be got initialized.

File UserControlHost.Designer.vb and UserControlToolWindow1.Designer.vb have system-generated code, like whatever I did manually with window corresponding to that code has been written there.

For file UserControlHost.vb refer [this](https://www.mztools.com/articles/2012/MZ2012017.aspx).
